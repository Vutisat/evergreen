# Recall
*A simple clipboard manager*

## How does it work?
Recall runs in the background waiting for you to copy text. When Recall detects you copying text it seamlessly copies it to persistent storage for later access.

When you want to copy a previously clipped element, simply pull down the notificaton shade, tap the notification and then select the clipping you want to copy from the list.

## Can I configure it?
Absolutely.

Currently Recall only allows you to specify a max buffer length -- this allows you to specify how many elements to keep in memory. By increasing this count, more elements are kept in memory.

In addition, Recall gives you the option for it to start on boot. This means that it will be running in the background the next time you need to access data you've clipped!
