# Recall
*A simple clipboard manager*

*Supports all versions of vanilla Android 4.2+*

## How does it work?
Recall runs in the background waiting for you to copy text. When Recall detects you copying text it seamlessly copies it to persistent storage for later access.

When you want to copy a previously clipped element, simply pull down the notificaton shade, tap the notification and then select the clipping you want to copy from the list.

In addition to access to the full list, Recall also provides other useful features accessable by swiping down the notification to reveal a Settings and "Quick Copy" button. By pressing "Quick Copy", the second-to-last clipped item will be placed on the clipboard.

## Can I configure it?
Absolutely.

Currently Recall only offers two settings: the ability for you to set a max buffer length and the ability for Recall to start on boot.

Changing the max buffer length determines how many clippings will be kept in memory and accessable via the quick access list.

If you allow Recall to start on boot, it will automatically be running when you next clip text!
